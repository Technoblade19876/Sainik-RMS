            <button style="width: 1200px;" class="Matter"  >My name is Gandham Dheeraj, at present I am studying 7th standard in ZPHS School, Gorantla. During Corona lockdown period, when I was studying  5th standard, I prepared for Sainik and Rashtriya Military School entrance exams myself by bringing all the material online. With the help of this online material, I could score 76% in Sainik School Exam and 68% in Rashtriya Military School Exam.

                I have prepared so much valuable material sitting in a corner of my house at that moment.  I have created a website and uploaded  the same with the hope that it might be useful to someone who wants to appear for the above entrance exams. Those who need it may download and utilise it. 
                
                This website has subject wise Math - 3087, English - 2155, GK & Science - 2375, Reasoning - 21725 total 9342 questions including all subjects. Wishing you all the best. <h2 style="font-size: 26px; color: white; text-align: right;">--- Your's, Gandham Dheeraj</h2></button>
